KAM Navigator Cytoscape Plugin V0.8
===================================

KAM Navigator is a [Cytoscape](http://www.cytoscape.org/) plugin that allows licensed [BEL Framework](http://www.belframework.org/) users to query, visualize, and 
manipulate BEL Framework Knowledge Assembly Models (KAMs) using Cytoscape. The Plugin uses the BEL Framework Web Services 
application to access KAMs and create native Cytoscape networks that can be analyzed and manipulated using the 
rich set of network-centric Cytoscape tools.

The KAM Navigator plugin was developed with two main goals:

-   To illustrate how the BEL Framework can easily interoperate with existing technologies, especially those which have a large community around them, and
-   To illustrate how to use the BEL Framework Web Services API to create innovative and interesting knowledge-aware applications.

The KAM Navigator plugin was designed and developed by [Selventa](http://www.selventa.com) and is being released 
for public use under the LGPLv3 license..
